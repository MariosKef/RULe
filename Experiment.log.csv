5/11/2021, Training using modified AutoKeras (It works),
12/11/2021, Modifying pipelines to compare MIPEGO and AutoKeras on RUL,
19/11/2021, Ran "greedy" autokeras. Will compare it to MIPEGO, PENDING check results, 50 (and 100 max trials) ,
19/11/2021, Started running bi-objective mipego experiments with total variance, Had issues with this (underfitting) - aborted, 200 (init=100), 
25/11/2021, Started running bi-objective mipego experiments with total variance, Had issues with this (stagnant process) - aborted, 100 (init=30),
26/11/2021, Training on entire dataset on best configs found from collected results of 25/11/2021, Had issues with this due to infinity,
26/11/2021, Run MIPEGO on objective on the low_std branch, It runs-no problem,
29/11/2021, Run MIPEGO on objective_total_var, It runs-no problem,100,
2/12/2021, Run MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std) , It runs-no problem,50 
3/12/2021, Run MIPEGO on new objective, It runs-no problem, 50 epochs (100 max 30 init),
7/12/2021, Run AutoKeras (greedy/default), Fixed dropout issue (it seems before it was not taking it into account, max trials 100 (stopped at trial 69) epochs 50,
8/12/2021, Run MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std), Issues with multiple GPUs being used and lot's of time for an evaluation compared to other times. Perhaps the large number of layers is to blame., 100 epochs (300 max 100 init)
9/12/2021, Run MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std) with [50-100] "neuron" vs [50-200] "neuron" on 8/12/2021, Interrupted as I had a better idea, 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
10/12/2021, Run  MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std_search_space_update) with new search space, No problem (although 289 samples instead of 300),  100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
14/12/2021, Run  MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std_search_space_update) with new search space ([1-3] num recurrent layers), No problems,  100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
25/12/2021, Run MIPEGO on new objective brunch (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std_new_objective), Multiple GPUs, 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
26/12/2021, Run  MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std_search_space_update) with new search space on dataset 3, No issues, 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
14/1/2022, Run single objective MIPEGO (RMSE) on feature/single_objective branch dataset 1, No problem , 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
16/1/2022, Run single objective MIPEGO (RMSE) on feature/single_objective branch dataset 3, No problem , 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
16/1/2022, Run full model on dataset1 based on experiments from 14/1/2022, ,100 epochs,
17/1/2022, ?
28/1/2022, Run  MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean (feature/uncertaity_no_cv_low_std_search_space_update) with new search space on dataset 2, NaN issue (pausing for now), 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
3/2/2022, Run single objective MIPEGO on feature/single_objective branch dataset 1 with harmonic mean of test uncertainty and test rmse, , 100 epochs (300 max 100 init),
