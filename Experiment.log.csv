28/10/2021, Training on entire dataset on best HP (knee-point) from experiment on 20/10/2021 until process plateaus or ends, ,100, 0.9176334618088126,9.780263948774268,0.34743556409305676,29.394772233694344
29/10/2021, Training on 200 epochs. Bas corrected issue.
2/11/2021, Training on entire dataset on best HP (knee-point) from experiment on 29/10/2021 (trained from Bas) until process plateaus or ends, ,75, 0.9923057400339986, 2.783821078960556, 0.01414039492678043, 33.061158991527016
4-5/11/2021, Modifying AutoKeras,
5/11/2021, Training using modified AutoKeras (It works),
12/11/2021, Modifying pipelines to compare MIPEGO and AutoKeras on RUL,
19/11/2021, Ran "greedy" autokeras. Will compare it to MIPEGO, PENDING check results, 50 (and 100 max trials) ,
19/11/2021, Started running bi-objective mipego experiments with total variance, Had issues with this (underfitting) - aborted, 200 (init=100), 
25/11/2021, Started running bi-objective mipego experiments with total variance, Had issues with this (stagnant process) - aborted, 100 (init=30),
26/11/2021, Training on entire dataset on best configs found from collected results of 25/11/2021, Had issues with this due to infinity,
26/11/2021, Run MIPEGO on objective on the low_std branch, It runs-no problem,
29/11/2021, Run MIPEGO on objective_total_var, It runs-no problem,100,
2/11/2021, Run MIPEGO on normal objective with median instead of mean, It runs-no problem,50
